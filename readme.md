# Intro
A week or so ago, I started playing a fair amount of [WORDLE](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

My strategy that I've been using is to guess "ROUTE" than "SLAIN", covering the vowels
as well as the RSTLN that Wheel of Fortune contestants used to guess (and get for free now).

Thought I'd poke a bit at seeing if there might be ways to have better guesses.  As a starting
point, I downloaded [sgb-words.txt](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt), 
which is apparently a common list of five-letter words used in Knuth's [Stanford GraphBase](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html).
